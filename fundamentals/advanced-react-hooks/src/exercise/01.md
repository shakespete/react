# useReducer: simple Counter

## 📝 Your Notes

Elaborate on your learnings here in `src/exercise/01.md`

## Background

React's `useState` hook can get you a really long way with React state
management. That said, sometimes you want to separate the state logic from the
components that make the state changes. In addition, if you have multiple
elements of state that typically change together, then having an object that
contains those elements of state can be quite helpful.

This is where `useReducer` comes in really handy. If you're familiar with redux,
then you'll feel pretty comfortable here. If not, then you have less to unlearn
😉

In this context, "reducer" is a reference to the function you pass to the
`Array.prototype.reduce` method:

```tsx
const numbers = [1, 2, 3]
// here's the reducer:
const sumReducer = (total, number) => total + number
const sum = numbers.reduce(sumReducer)
```

When originally conceived, `reduce` was intended to take an array, and "reduce"
it down to a single value. Turns out that value can be literally anything you
want, so sometimes the array can be "reduced" to something bigger than the
original array and now the name is a bit of a misnomer 🙃.

Where a reducer operates on an array synchronously one item at a time,
`useReducer` operates on the state value and "events" that happen _over_ time.

This exercise will take you pretty deep into `useReducer`. Typically, you'll use
`useReducer` with an object of state, but we're going to start by managing a
single number (a `count`, but don't worry, we'll get to a more real-world
exercise once you have nailed down the fundamentals here). We're doing this to
ease you into `useReducer` and help you learn the difference between the
convention and the actual API.

Here's an example of using `useReducer` to manage the value of a name in an
input.

```tsx
function nameReducer(previousName: string, newName: string) {
  return newName
}

const initialNameValue = 'Joe'

function NameInput() {
  const [name, setName] = React.useReducer(nameReducer, initialNameValue)
  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Name:{' '}
        <input
          defaultValue={name}
          onChange={event => setName(event.target.value)}
        />
      </label>
      <div>You typed: {name}</div>
    </>
  )
}
```

One important thing to note here is that the reducer (called `nameReducer`
above) is called with two arguments:

1. the current state
2. whatever it is that the dispatch function (called `setName` above) is called
   with (in the above example, `event.target.value` is sent as the 2nd argument
   to the reducer). This is often referred to as an "action."

If you're a bit confused about that 2nd argument, don't worry, this is part of
the reason I've structured the exercise/extra credits the way I have. You'll be
playing with this a lot!

One of the primary benefits of `useReducer` is the ability to put the logic of
your component's state management into one place rather than being scattered
around event handlers and `useEffect` callbacks.

That's as much as I'm going to give you to start. It may seem like precious
little, but we'll be iterating on the same example several times to help you
explore the API and this is not the only exercise you'll have with `useReducer`.
Remember, Googling is normal when working through these exercises.

## Exercise

Production deploys:

- [Exercise](https://advanced-react-hooks.netlify.com/isolated/exercise/01.tsx)
- [Final](https://advanced-react-hooks.netlify.com/isolated/final/01.tsx)

We're going to start off as simple as possible with a `<Counter />` component.
`useReducer` is absolutely overkill for a counter component like ours, but for
now, just focus on making things work with `useReducer`.

For this exercise and its extra credits, I want to open your mind to the power
of the reducer function. So what we'll do is I'll give you a change to the API
and then I want to to figure out how to rewrite your reducer to make that API
work. Just pretend that our friend 👨‍💼 Peter the Product Manager is giving you
ever-changing requirements and you'll feel right at home! 😅

## Extra Credit

### 1. 💯 accept the step as the action

[Production deploy](https://advanced-react-hooks.netlify.com/isolated/final/01.extra-1.tsx)

I want to change things a bit to have this API:

```javascript
const [count, changeCount] = React.useReducer(countReducer, initialCount)
const increment = () => changeCount(step)
const decrement = () => changeCount(-step)
```

How would you need to change your reducer to make this work?

This one is just to show that you can pass anything as the action.

### 2. 💯 simulate setState with an object

[Production deploy](https://advanced-react-hooks.netlify.com/isolated/final/01.extra-2.tsx)

Remember `this.setState` from class components? If not, lucky you 😉. Either
way, let's see if you can figure out how to make the state updater (`dispatch`
function) behave in a similar way by changing our `state` to an object
(`{count: 0}`) and then calling the state updater with an object which merges
with the current state.

So here's how I want things to look now:

```javascript
const [state, setState] = React.useReducer(countReducer, {
  count: initialCount,
})
const {count} = state
const increment = () => setState({count: count + step})
const decrement = () => setState({count: count - step})
```

How would you need to change the reducer to make this work?

🦉 As a general reminder, React does not work well with data mutation (like
`state.changedProp = 'hi'`, or `Object.assign(state, {changedProp: 'hi'})`).
React uses object identity to perform certain optimizations. For example, if you
return the same state value from your reducer then React assumes you don't need
to re-render. For performance reasons, React doesn't do a deep property
comparison of the state object so it doesn't know/care whether properties of
that object were changed.

So, instead of mutating the state you need to create an entirely new object and
copy properties over (like `{...state, changedProp: 'hi'}`). In some reducers
managing a large amount of state this property copying is pretty annoying and
there are tools to make it easier (lookup "immer"), but most of the time that's
not necessary.

### 3. 💯 simulate setState with an object OR function

[Production deploy](https://advanced-react-hooks.netlify.com/isolated/final/01.extra-3.tsx)

`this.setState` from class components can also accept a function. So let's add
support for that with our simulated `setState` function. See if you can figure
out how to make your reducer support both the object as in the last extra credit
as well as a function callback:

```javascript
const [state, setState] = React.useReducer(countReducer, {
  count: initialCount,
})
const {count} = state
const increment = () =>
  setState(currentState => ({count: currentState.count + step}))
const decrement = () =>
  setState(currentState => ({count: currentState.count - step}))
```

### 4. 💯 traditional dispatch object with a type and switch statement

[Production deploy](https://advanced-react-hooks.netlify.com/isolated/final/01.extra-4.tsx)

Ok, now we can finally see what most people do conventionally (mostly thanks to
redux). Update your reducer so I can do this:

```javascript
const [state, dispatch] = React.useReducer(countReducer, {
  count: initialCount,
})
const {count} = state
const increment = () => dispatch({type: 'increment', step})
const decrement = () => dispatch({type: 'decrement', step})
```

## 🦉 Other notes

### lazy initialization

This one's not an extra credit, but _sometimes_ lazy initialization can be
useful, so here's how we'd do that with our original hook App:

```javascript
function init(initialStateFromProps) {
  return {
    status: 'idle',
    data: null,
    error: null,
    ...initialStateFromProps,
  }
}

// ...

const [state, dispatch] = React.useReducer(reducer, props.initialState, init)
```

So, if you pass a third function argument to `useReducer`, it passes the second
argument to that function and uses the return value for the initial state.

This could be useful if our `init` function read into localStorage or something
else that we wouldn't want happening every re-render.

### Where to put the reducer

You may have noticed that we put our reducer outside the function component.
This is just a convention and you could just as easily put it inline as an
anonymous function if you wanted to. I prefer to extract it because in practical
settings the reducer is a bit longer and I also like pulling functions as close
to the root-level of the module as possible (learn more on my blog:
[Why I avoid nesting closures](/blog/why-i-avoid-nesting-closures)).
